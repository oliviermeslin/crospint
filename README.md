#  `crospint`: Coordinate Rotation for Spatial Interpolation

This package provides a few functions and classes for efficient spatial interpolation using coordinate rotation and ensemble methods. It also provides the algorithms used in Meslin [2026].

# 📦 Spatio-Temporal ML Utilities

This package provides lightweight utilities and `scikit-learn`-compatible transformers to build **machine learning pipelines for spatio-temporal interpolation** with tree-based ensemble methods. It has three distinctive features:

- It offers a native `sklearn.Pipeline` integration;
- It uses [`polars`](https://pola.rs/) for fast feature engineering but is also fully [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/)-compatible to simplify use with other ML libraries;
- It is agnostic to the algorithms used for interpolation (though is uses [`lightgbm`](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) by default).

This package also contains functions and classes uses to model housing prices at the national scale (see Meslin [2026]).

## Installation

Just execute `uv add crospint` or `pip install crospint`.
